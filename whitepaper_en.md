# What’s Pangaea?
Pangaea is a keyboard that isolates the key layout into several “islands” and allows the user to move the position of each island freely.   As an island, it is divided into three parts: the main body, the thumb section, and the little finger section.  We named it Pangaea, comparing the movement of a chunk of the key arrangement to the theory of continental drift.

# What can it do?
By moving the island, you can adjust the key layout to suit your preference and hand shape. Just as you adjust the seat height and back angle of a chair while checking its comfort, you can adjust the keyboard to a shape that is easy to use while using it.

# Why Pangaea?
What was it made for?
Original experience (by @otahinosame)

There are various column-staggered keyboards, but the differences that interest me are the height of the little finger and the position of the thumb keys. However, you won’t know which one fits you until you try it out. You can’t test it in actual use without spending tens of thousands Yen(JPY) to make it. I want to at least make sure how high it fits before I buy the kit. (I want to avoid local solutions, I want to avoid bias since I’ve just bought it, I want to actually compare and decide.)

# What kind of things do we want?
I want a keyboard that can be easily adjusted while in use. I want a kit that can easily make keyboards with adjustable key layouts. Everyone wants it! That’s how we came to develop this kit.

# How Pangaea works?
Relative positions of islands are connected with connecting parts. They can be freely movable or fixed. For example, by combining plates with slits on the rails, the position and angle can be continuously adjusted.  Electrical connections between islands can be made by using flexible wiring, allowing islands to move while wired together.  Islands can be freely replaced or expanded according to Pangaea specifications. Additional elements can also be connected freely.  The following is the examples of future expansion and support.

- Hardware
  - Variety of parts with different layouts
  - Row and Staggered Arrays
  - Orthogonal Linear
- Usage support
  - Expanded guides for adjusting placement
  - Introduction of custom examples
